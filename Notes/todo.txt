TODO
- switch over to presymtomatic (c2) paradigm (bI*(.4 through .6)=bA)
    - k (.15 through .7), use .5 for now

- divide every cost value in a cost function heatmap by the lowest of the values, letting us do comparisons

- check fit for richmond in new data
- extend data out and see what the time series looks like
- get R0 and plot it on a time series
    - compare to initial R0 estimate (without social distancing)
    - plot time series
- look at other counties, see what time series looks like

- other methods of talking r0?
    - non-immunity granting diseases, how do they calculate r0
    - "waning immunity"
- testing rate problems?

ESTIMATING R-EFFECTIVE
- r_effective = r0 under control measures
- in terms of different cities

infectious immigration rate?

hospitalized class?
