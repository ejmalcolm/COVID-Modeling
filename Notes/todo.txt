- start a week or two back from the initial case y0=1
	- start with the actual case number if you're doing it automatically

- add a degree of freedom with b_P, basically c1 vs c2
	- output a cost heatmap

- redo figures

SOCIAL DISTANCING
- beta value as polynomial
	- lets beta value change over time
- force beta to be positive max(polynomial, 0)

gamma vs nu
- percentage deceased, percentage recovered (.01*gam=nu .01 = CHANCE OF DYING)


ESTIMATING R-EFFECTIVE
- r_effective = r0 under control measures
- in terms of different cities

infectious immigration rate?

hospitalized class?
