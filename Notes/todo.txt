SOCIAL DISTANCING
- beta value as polynomial
	- lets beta value change over time
- force beta to be positive max(polynomial, 0)
- define beta_I to put it in a different function
- quadratic, x^3, logistic, nu*I 
- betahat vs alpha, fix alpha at several values
- switch to maybe a function of death rate, use the polynomial to see the relation
- bi_0 * (dD/dt)^alpha
- exponential: bI decreases exponentially as the death rate increases
- compare different functions of beta, see what curve fit values match for the parameters
- from wolbachia paper: linear, logistic, exponential functions (steal)

TOTAL CASES
- run with bi fixed, unfixed, see what c effects are

- run cost heatmap with values of c>1 again

- fix b_A = .1*bI, fit for k vs c2 (presymptomatic)

- markov-chain monte carlo

gamma vs nu
- percentage deceased, percentage recovered (.01*gam=nu .01 = CHANCE OF DYING)


ESTIMATING R-EFFECTIVE
- r_effective = r0 under control measures
- in terms of different cities
