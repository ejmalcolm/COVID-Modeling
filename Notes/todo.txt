DONE
- before SD implementation:
    - k vs c2, b_A=.1*bI, fit for bI, slightly better fit than having c1=c2
    - cost values-- cost function decreases with increasing C value for a long time, at least up to c=100, but gains diminish)

SOCIAL DISTANCING
- using a death parameter
- reverses the k trend
- better fits

ESTIMATING R-EFFECTIVE
- r_effective = r0 under control measures
- in terms of different cities

infectious immigration rate?

hospitalized class?
