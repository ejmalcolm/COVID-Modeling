**TODO**

feed the differnet BI function forms a dummy set of data and see what results
get better guesses! latin hypercube sampling, debinfer


DONE TODAY:
- to get R0, define a separate function that takes in death and all of the constant values
- get R0 and plot it on a time series
- comparing: muscokogee, georgia (columbus) | richmond city, virginia
    -R0 comparison figure


QUESTIONS/CONCERNS/ISSUES:
- at the 4 corner parameters, look at the alpha and beta values for each
- R0 behavior: spikes very high, seems to decrease quite quickly
- R0 behavior: longer timeframes are producing higher R0 values, to the point of very high for the largest timeframe

intreprations of beta function

POSSIBLE BIG QUESTION: how do we deal with r0 when we might be making things worse?

ESTIMATING R-EFFECTIVE
- r_effective = r0 under control measures
- in terms of different cities

infectious immigration rate?

hospitalized class?

- other methods of talking r0?
    - non-immunity granting diseases, how do they calculate r0
    - "waning immunity"
- testing rate problems?
