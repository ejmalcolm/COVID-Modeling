plot R0_k vs. c and R0_c vs. k

heatmap: fix k at .2, bi and c on the axes, output = r0

leastsq()? get least_squares() working with the boarding school example?
	COST FUNCTIONS

gamma vs nu

change sigma value to the new one from robert's dataset

---
SOCIAL DISTANCING
- beta value as polynomial
	- lets beta value change over time

ESTIMATING R-EFFECTIVE
- r_effective = r0 under control measures
- in terms of different cities

--

- fix bI value, look at different c and k values and what r0/total cases result
	-selecting it: around beta = 2, maybe vary it manually
-  graph c values <1
