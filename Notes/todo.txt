**TODO**

to get R0, define a separate function that takes in death and all of the constant values

feed the differnet BI function forms a dummy set of data and see what results

get better guesses! latin hypercube sampling, debinfer

investigate the small timeframe
    - at the 4 corner parameters, look at the alpha and beta values for each
    - pull a k and c combination, see what happens to beta (timeseries)
    - check out the # of symptomatic infections instead of death rate for the equation, see what happens

- get R0 and plot it on a time series
    - compare to initial R0 estimate (without social distancing)
    - plot time series
- look at other counties, see what time series looks like
- other datasets: muscokogee, georgia (columbus) | jackson, missisipi

intreprations of beta function

POSSIBLE BIG QUESTION: how do we deal with r0 when we might be making things worse?

ESTIMATING R-EFFECTIVE
- r_effective = r0 under control measures
- in terms of different cities

infectious immigration rate?

hospitalized class?

- other methods of talking r0?
    - non-immunity granting diseases, how do they calculate r0
    - "waning immunity"
- testing rate problems?
