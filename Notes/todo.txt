**TODO**

investigate the small timeframe
    - at the 4 corner parameters, look at the alpha and beta values for each
    - pull a k and c combination, see what happens to beta (timeseries)
    - check out the # of symptomatic infections instead of death rate for the equation, see what happens

- get R0 and plot it on a time series
    - compare to initial R0 estimate (without social distancing)
    - plot time series
- look at other counties, see what time series looks like
- other datasets: muscokogee, georgia (columbus) | jackson, missisipi


**NOTES**
- very good fit for richmond
- weird data for philly
- need the original r0 formula so we can rewrite it for the presymptomatic version

**DONE**
- changed sigma, recovery values based off the eikenberry mask paper
- divide every cost value in a cost function heatmap by the lowest of the values, letting us do comparisons
- switch over to presymtomatic (c2) paradigm (bI*(.4 through .6)=bA)
    - k (.15 through .7), use .5 for now
- extend data out and see what the time series looks like
- check fit for richmond in new data

POSSIBLE BIG QUESTION: how do we deal with r0 when we might be making things worse?

ESTIMATING R-EFFECTIVE
- r_effective = r0 under control measures
- in terms of different cities

infectious immigration rate?

hospitalized class?

- other methods of talking r0?
    - non-immunity granting diseases, how do they calculate r0
    - "waning immunity"
- testing rate problems?
