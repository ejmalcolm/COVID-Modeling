NOTE: These figures are largely generated with old parameters. See the "-14 to +21" folder for new values.

This is a directory containing figures generated with the time period that STARTS with the first detected case and proceeds for 21 days (3 weeks.)

CONTAINS

CurveFitFigures -- Contains time-series plots showing the model output compared to actual case data.

R0Heatmaps -- Contains a series of heatmaps with R0 information.
  r0_heatmap_bI=2 -- R0 Heatmap when bI is fixed.
  r0_heatmap_bI=unfixed -- R0 heatmap when bI is unfixed (fitted).
  r0_heatmap_c_vs_bI -- R0 heatmap with k=.2, with c vs. bI on the axes
  r0_heatmap_c<1_bI=2 -- R0 heatmap with bI fixed, c values below 1
  r0_heatmap_c<1_bI=unfixed -- R0 heatmap with bI unfixed, c values below 1

bI_Heatmap -- heatmap of curve-fit bI values, k vs. c
